# Algebraic Data Types
For this next lecture, we will be going over algebraic data types. They share certain properties with objects in java, but are also quite different at the same time. To familiarize yourself with ADTs, we will use [Learn You a Good Haskell's ADT notes](http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses). I recommend reading up to the section on type synonyms.
